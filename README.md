# Mini-moulinette

![mini-moulinette](mini-moulinette.jpg)

Mini-moulinette is a test runner for 42 assignments, providing automated tests for whole assignment with one command. The goal is to make thorough checking before submitting the assignments, with ease.


## Introduction

This is now day 11 of piscine. I have wasted so many hours getting evaluated, doing evaluation, waiting for evaluation, only to come back redoing it again because I kept making silly mistakes. I wish I can check my code thoroughly before submitting, but that too, will take a lot of my time. This is why I build this so I can stop wasting my time and many others, and shut moulinette up with just a single submission.


## How Does It Work?

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

- Mini moulinette runs through all the tests cases automatically, and checks if the test conditions are met.
- It will then output the result.
- The scores are based on 42's practice, where if easier/earlier questions are incorrect, the rest won't count.


# Updating

Mini moulinette is updated daily, to update:

```bash
cd ~/mini-moulinette
```

```bash
git pull
```


## Get Started

> ***Warning***
> Mini moulinette is not 100% accurate, the tests may not cover every edge cases like moulinette. Use with caution.

1. Go to your root `~` directory.

```bash
cd ~
```


2. Clone the git there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khairulhaaziq/mini-moulinette.git
```


3. Now create an alias for it.

- zsh:

```zsh
echo "alias mini='~/mini-moulinette/mini-moul.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

- bash:

```bash
echo "alias mini='~/mini-moulinette/mini-moul.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```


4. Go to your assignment directory where you want to test: e.g: C02 directory

```bash
cd C02
```


5. Run using command `mini` with assignment number as argument. e.g: C02.

```bash
mini C02
```

e.g: C03

```bash
mini C03
```

6. You can now run it for every assignment directory, where tests are provided. Have fun!

## Debugging

The error/success messages should be explicit enough. However sometimes you will get segmentation fault or your code doesn't compile

### If your code doesn't compile

- Check the headers
- Check if it contains main inside
- Check if your function name is similar to a function from standard library, if it is then it will have problem

### If you receive segmentation fault

- You need to find the test cases, go here:

```bash
cd ~/mini-moulinette/mini-moul/tests
```

The current directory contains all the test cases. Every test is in the file that is the same name as the function/program it is testing, e.g. C05/ex00/ft_iterative_factorial.c will contain test for C05 > ex00 > ft_iterative_factorial.c.

The test cases are usually put in a list of array in this structure, e.g. for ft_iterative_factorial test:

``` C
 t_test tests[] = {
        {
            .desc = "Factorial of 0",
            .n = 0,
            .expected = 1,
        },
        {
            .desc = "Factorial of 1",
            .n = 1,
            .expected = 1,
        },
        {
            .desc = "Factorial of 2",
            .n = 2,
            .expected = 2,
        },
        {
            .desc = "Factorial of 10",
            .n = 10,
            .expected = 3628800,
        },
        {
            .desc = "Factorial of a negative number",
            .n = -5,
            .expected = 0,
        },
 }
```


## Customizing

See the above, you can add more tests here. You need to manage your customization yourself when you pull for updates though.
